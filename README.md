## Hi, I'm Robert, a data analyst with sport management background👋

👀 I'm passionate about turning raw data into valuable insights and solutions for businesses. My background in managing complex operations 
  and leading teams gives me a unique perspective on how data can be used to optimize processes, improve efficiency, and achieve strategic goals.

🌱 I’m a Data Analyst with expertise in SQL, PYTHON, TABLEAU and GOOGLE-SHEETS.

🤝 Seeking opportunities to collaborate on data analysis projects involving PYTHON (including Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and Matplotlib),
    SQL, EXCEL, GOOGLE-SHEETS and data visualization with tools like TABLEAU.

👨‍💻 I am a family person and enjoy spending time with my children. I also keep fit at the gym, enjoy going to the cinema and learning more about data analysis. 
   I love working on my own projects and discovering new countries and cultures.

🌱 This GitHub profile documents my ongoing learning journey in data analysis.  I'm eager to connect and continue growing together through data-driven projects!

📫 I'm open to new opportunities and collaborations in data analysis.
